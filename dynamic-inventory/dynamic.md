**include_role vs import_role**

`include_role`

  -  it includes at run time, checks while processing.    include   will not respect tags. We must explicitly set inside the tasks

`import_role`

  - imports the role before exection and parse it, checks before processing. applying tags at the import setup to all the tasks automatically.

`dynamic inventory`

   - autoscaling, when trafic increase servers will be increased
   - a plugin is provided aws and ansible to fetch the IP address dynamically

**query aws**
 -us-east-1, ec2, running and name should be frontend

 - tasks -> execute something on the remote/target server
 - plugins -> connects to other system and fetch required information

`*.aws_ec2.yml/yaml`

  -ansible can connect to AWS dynamically to fetch the IP address using dynamic inventory plugin(amazon.aws.aws_ec2), this helps in autoscaling kind of environment, where fetching the IP address statically is not possible

`secrets`

  - vault -> secured place to keep the secrets

`ansible-vault`

  - ansible-vault create vault.yaml

`secrets manager`

  - AWS is a platform

  - hashicorp vault
